# 🧠 PersonaForge

What if you could simulate anyone — yourself, a fictional character, or a public figure — and talk to them like they’re actually there?

**PersonaForge** is an AI-powered character emulator that lets you generate highly realistic conversational agents with memory, personality, and tone — all deployable through a shareable chat interface.

> Build your AI twin. Create fictional personas. Clone digital voices.  
> This is AI as presence — not just output.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Create a **digital twin** of yourself (or anyone else)
- Capture unique tone, quirks, inside jokes, and language style
- Store long-term memory across conversations
- Generate public or private shareable chat interfaces
- Expandable to multi-character simulations
